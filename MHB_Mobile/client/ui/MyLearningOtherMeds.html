      <h3> What is an oral anticoagulant? </h3>
      <p> 
        A blood thinner is a kind of drug called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants help to prevent new blood clots from forming and help to keep existing blood clots from getting worse. 
        <br><br>
        Blood clots can put you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other serious medical problems. 
        <br><br>
        Using aspirin, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen or Motrin, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants together may increase your risk for bleeding. 
        <br><br>
        <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Be sure to tell all of your doctors and dentists about all of the medications you are taking, including those you take without a prescription, vitamins or nutritional supplements (such as vitamin E or fish oil), and herbal medications (such as St. Johnâ€™s Wort). </span>
        <br><br>
        Your doctors will obtain blood tests that measure your blood levels and check for signs of hidden bleeding or other conditions while you are on an anticoagulant drug.
