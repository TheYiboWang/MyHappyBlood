        <strong>Keep your diet the same if you are taking warfarin</strong> <br>
        Keep your diet the same. <br>
        Do not make any major changes in your diet or start a weight loss plan before calling your doctor first.
        <br> <br> 
        <strong>Stay Safe while taking your blood thinner</strong> <br>
        Call your doctor and go to the hospital immediately if you have had a bad fall or a hard bump, even if you are not bleeding. You can be bleeding but not see any blood. For example, if you fall and hit your head, bleeding can occur inside your skull. Or, if you hurt your arm during a fall and then notice a large purple bruise, this means you are bleeding under your skin. <br><br>
        Because you are taking a blood thinner, you should try not to hurt yourself and cause bleeding. You need to be careful when you use knives, scissors, razors, or any sharp object that can make you bleed. <br><br>
        You also need to avoid activities and sports that could cause injury. Swimming and walking are safe activities. If you would like to start a new activity that will increase the amount of exercise you get every day, talk to your doctor. <br><br>
        You can still do many things that you enjoy. If you like to work in the yard, you still can. Just be sure to wear sturdy shoes and gloves to protect yourself. Or, if you like to ride your bike, be sure you wear a helmet.

        Keep a current list of all the medicines you take. <br><br>
        Ask your doctor about whether you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.<br><br>

        <br><br>

        <strong>Tell your doctor </strong><br><br>
        Always tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking. <br><br>
        Tell your doctor when you start taking new medicine, when you stop taking a medicine, and if the amount of medicine you are taking changes. <br><br>
        When you visit your doctor, bring a list of current medicines, over-the-counter drugs—such as aspirin— and any vitamins and herbal products you take.<br><br>
