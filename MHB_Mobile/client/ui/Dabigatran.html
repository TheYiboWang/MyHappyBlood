        Dabigatran comes as a capsule taken by mouth. This medicine will reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with a serious heart rhythm problem called non-valvular atrial fibrillation. 
        <br><br>
        With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can cause blood clots to form, increasing your risk of a stroke. 
        <br><br>
