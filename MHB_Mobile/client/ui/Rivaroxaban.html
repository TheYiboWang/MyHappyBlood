    Rivaroxaban comes as a tablet taken by mouth. This medicine will reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with a serious heart rhythm problem called non-valvular atrial fibrillation and in people undergoing knee or hip replacement.
    <br><br>
    With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can cause blood clots to form, increasing your risk of a stroke. 
    <br><br> 
    Rivaroxaban is also used after hip or knee replacement surgery to prevent thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism.
    <br><br>
    Your doctor will decide appropriate dose and how long you should take rivaroxaban depends on the indications. Do not stop talking rivaroxaban without first talking with your doctor.  Stopping rivaroxaban may increase your risk of stroke or harmful clots forming in the blood vessels. If you have to stop taking rivaroxaban, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.
    <br><br>
    Take rivaroxaban exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Take it with water, with or without food. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If your next dose is less than 6 hours away, skip the missed dose. Do not take a double dose.
