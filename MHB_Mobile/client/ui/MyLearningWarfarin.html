      <h3>Using Other Medicines</h3>
      <p> Tell your doctor about every medicine you take. The doctor needs to know about all your medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products you used before you started taking a blood thinner. <br><br>
        Medicines you get over the counter may also interact with your blood thinner. Following is a list of some common medicines that you should talk with your doctor or pharmacist about before using. <br><br>
        Pain relievers, cold medicines, or stomach remedies, such as:

      <h3>Warfarin and Diet</h3>
      <p>i) Rivaroxaban (riv-are- ox-a-ban) will reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with a serious heart rhythm problem called non-valvular atrial fibrillation and in people undergoing knee or hip replacement. <br><br>
    ii) With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can cause blood clots to form, increasing your risk of a stroke. Rivaroxaban is also used after hip or knee replacement surgery to prevent thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs.<br><br> 
    iii) Do not stop taking rivaroxaban without first talking with your doctor. Take rivaroxaban exactly as prescribed by your doctor. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If your next dose is less than 6 hours away, skip the missed dose. Do not take a double dose. <br><br>
    iv) Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. <br><br>
