        Apixaban comes as a tablet taken by mouth. This medicine will reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with a serious heart rhythm problem called non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
        <br><br>
	       With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can cause blood clots to form, increasing your risk of a stroke.
