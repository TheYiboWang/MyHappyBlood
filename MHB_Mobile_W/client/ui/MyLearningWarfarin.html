      <h3>About Warfarin (Coumadin<sup>&reg;</sup>)</h3>
      <p>  
      <div align="center"><img src="img/dose.png" height="62" width="209" align="center"> </div>
        Warfarin is a blood thinner (anticoagulant) that comes as a tablet to be taken by mouth. This medicine will help prevent new blood blots from forming and keep existing blood clots from getting bigger. <br> <br> 
        Your warfarin dose is based on what you eat and drink, what other medications you take, and how you feel. It takes a few days to a week to start working. <br><br>
        Your doctor will tell you how long you need to take warfarin. Always take your warfarin as directed, at the same time of the day, every day. <br><br>
        Never skip a dose, and never take a double dose. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you don’t remember until the next day, call your doctor for instructions.<br><br>

      <h3>Taking Other Medicines</h3>
      <p> Many medications interact with warfarin and affect how it works. <br><br>

      Talk to your doctor before starting, stopping, or changing any medications (including over-the-counter products, nutritional supplements, and herbal remedies). <br><br>

      Using aspirin, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen or Motrin, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants together may increase your risk for bleeding. <br><br>

      <strong>Be sure to tell all of your doctors and dentists about all of the medications you are taking,</strong> including those you take without a prescription, vitamins or nutritional supplements (such as vitamin E or fish oil), and herbal medications (such as St. John’s Wort).

    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Food with Vitamin K</h3>
      <p>
      Eat a balanced, healthy diet. Vitamin K from your food can affect how well warfarin works for you. <br><br> 
      <span style='color:red;'>It is important to keep your vitamin K intake about the same from day to day. Leafy green vegetables,</span> such as kale, parsley, spinach, turnip or collard greens, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and others, contain large amounts of <span style='color:red;'>vitamin K.</span>
      <br><br>
      If you eat these foods, please eat consistent portion sizes each week. Avoid drastic changes in your diet.
      <br><br>
      Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days or if you have stomach problems, vomiting, or diarrhea that last more than one day. Your warfarin dose may need to be adjusted if you are ill.
      <br><br>
      While you are taking warfarin, <span style='color:red;'>you should avoid drinking alcohol.</span> If you choose to drink, limit 1 to 2 drinks per day.

      <h3>Blood Tests (INR)</h3>

      <p>
        Your doctor will obtain blood tests that measure your blood levels and check for signs of hidden bleeding or other conditions while you are on an anticoagulant drug. 
        <br><br>
        You will need to have your blood tested often if you are taking warfarin. The blood test helps your doctor decide how much medicine you need. 
        <br><br>
        The Prothrombin Time (PT) or the International Normalized Ratio (<strong>INR</strong>) blood test measures how fast your blood clots and lets the doctor know if your dose needs to be changed.  
        <br><br>
        Testing your blood helps your doctor keep you in a safe range. If there is too much warfarin in your body, you could bleed too much. If there is not enough, you could get a blood clot. 
        <br><br>
        Once your blood test is in your target range and your dose is reached, this test is done less often. 
        <br><br>
        Because your dose is based on the INR blood test, <strong>it is very important that you get your blood tested at regular frequent appointment. </strong>
        <br><br>
        Daily activity: your activity level can change your INR. Tell your doctor if anything changes  - starting exercising and stopping exercising. Weight gain/loss can affect INR.
